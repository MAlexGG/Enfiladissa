This is my resume made with HTML5, CSS3 and javascript vanilla, it's a flirtatious design where I show diferent information distributed in a lateral nav bar. I added some css animations for a more dynamic experience.
I made de UX/UI design in Figma both desktop and mobile. It's responsive.

### UI Design
